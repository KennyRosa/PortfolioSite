- PORTFOLIO SITE

Welcome! My name is Kenny Rosa. In the past, I worked in a variety of different fields, mostly in customer service. However, I believe I am now where I should be, in the technology space. Since technology is changing as we speak, it creates an atmosphere where I can continue learning, which in turn can produce creative work. That is what I truly love about this field. In that sense, I continue to grow each and every day and I am always looking forward to my next learning experience or programming language.

Created a portfolio site to show-case projects I have completed in the past and will continue to complete. I love the idea that this site will actually never be finished due to new projects being added and new designs as I continue to learn/expand. It also displays a bit more information of myself on a personal level.
